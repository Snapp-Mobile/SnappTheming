`SnappTheming` is a Swift framework designed to streamline the process of integrating dynamic design themes into iOS applications. By leveraging JSON declarations, the framework allows developers to easily extract and apply various theming elements such as colors, fonts, gradients, and shape styles, directly into their appâ€™s user interface.

### Key Features:

- JSON-based Theme Management: Easily manage and configure themes using JSON files, allowing for flexible theming without modifying source code.
- Gradient Support: Supports linear, radial, and angular gradients to enhance UI elements with rich, dynamic backgrounds.
- Shape Styling: Define and apply reusable shape styles, including colors and gradients, to various UI components, including buttons, backgrounds, and custom shapes.
- Font Management: Automatically register and unregister custom fonts, with easy integration of different font types.
- Extensibility: The framework is designed to be modular, enabling the addition of new theming elements as needed.

### Benefits:

- Consistency: Ensures a uniform and customizable design system across all screens and components in your app.
- Efficiency: Reduce the need for hardcoded styling by decoupling design values from code.
- Flexibility: Supports dynamic theming, making it possible to switch themes or update design values without requiring app updates.
